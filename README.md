## Types of Leather
[ToC](#table-of-contents)

### 1. Full Grain Leather

**Description:**  
The highest quality, retaining the entire grain layer of the hide. It's not sanded or buffed, preserving its natural texture and strength.

**Characteristics:**  
Most durable, ages beautifully with a unique patina, and often more expensive.

**Uses:**  
High-end products like belts, wallets, and shoes.

---

### 2. Top Grain Leather

**Description:**  
The second highest grade, created by sanding down the top layer of the hide to remove imperfections. It may also be embossed with a pattern.

**Characteristics:**  
More consistent appearance than full grain, still durable, but less so than full grain.

**Uses:**  
Commonly used in furniture, handbags, and other products where a smooth surface is desired.

---

### 3. Split Grain Leather

**Description:**  
Created by splitting the hide into multiple layers, often separating the top grain from the corium (the inner layer).

**Characteristics:**  
Less durable than full or top grain, can be made into suede by napping the flesh side.

**Uses:**  
Suede products, lining, and sometimes furniture.

---

### 4. Genuine Leather

**Description:**  
Refers to the remaining layers after the top grain is removed.

**Characteristics:**  
Lower quality than top grain, less durable and may be treated to look more appealing.

**Uses:**  
Often used in belts, wallets, and other lower-cost leather goods.

---

### 5. Bonded Leather

**Description:**  
Made from leftover leather scraps and fibers that are bonded together with a polyurethane or latex adhesive.

**Characteristics:**  
The lowest grade, least durable, and most affordable.

**Uses:**  
Upholstery, bookbinding, and other applications where cost is a major factor.
