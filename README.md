## Types of Leather
[ToC](#table-of-contents)

### 1. Full Grain Leather

**Description:**  
The highest quality, retaining the entire grain layer of the hide. It's not sanded or buffed, preserving its natural texture and strength.
**Characteristics:**  
Most durable, ages beautifully with a unique patina, and often more expensive.
**Uses:**  
High-end products like belts, wallets, and shoes.

---

### 2. Top Grain Leather

**Description:**  
The second highest grade, created by sanding down the top layer of the hide to remove imperfections. It may also be embossed with a pattern.

**Characteristics:**  
More consistent appearance than full grain, still durable, but less so than full grain.

**Uses:**  
Commonly used in furniture, handbags, and other products where a smooth surface is desired.

---

### 3. Split Grain Leather

**Description:**  
Created by splitting the hide into multiple layers, often separating the top grain from the corium (the inner layer).

**Characteristics:**  
Less durable than full or top grain, can be made into suede by napping the flesh side.

**Uses:**  
Suede products, lining, and sometimes furniture.

---

### 4. Genuine Leather

**Description:**  
Refers to the remaining layers after the top grain is removed.

**Characteristics:**  
Lower quality than top grain, less durable and may be treated to look more appealing.

**Uses:**  
Often used in belts, wallets, and other lower-cost leather goods.

---

### 5. Bonded Leather

**Description:**  
Made from leftover leather scraps and fibers that are bonded together with a polyurethane or latex adhesive.

**Characteristics:**  
The lowest grade, least durable, and most affordable.

**Uses:**  
Upholstery, bookbinding, and other applications where cost is a major factor.

#### 7/23/2025
- Drew up two patterns for leather knife sheath
- After looking into I noticed the way the client wants the sheath will not be possible
    I had talked to Diomedies industries about the design and it just won't be possible with leather.
    The client had wanted the knife sheath to have grommets on the outside following the blade and for it to be able to go upside down
    on a backpack strap like in the movies. The problem is the blade does not have a hilt to attach a strap to hold the blade in place.
    Without anything to hold the blade it will fall right out. I thought about putting magnets inside to keep the blade secure but
    I wouldn't want to trust the magnets to do the correct job. Asking my Dad to send info to the client to see if they are ok
    with changing the pattern or if I should just return the knife sheath.
- Started to tinker with Github pages to explore options for static generating a website to host this info in a more
    user friendly readable format.
